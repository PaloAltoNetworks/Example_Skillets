# Skillets

Skillets are sharable units of automation tools and configurations. Skillets are most commonly used to
share loadable configurations for PAN-OS devices. Skillets can be loaded using several tools including
[Panhandler](github.com/Paloaltonetworks/panhandler). 

## Skillet types

Although most skillets consist of loadable PAN-OS configurations, Panhandler can also load additional types
of Skillets including:

* Terraform
* Python
* REST

For more information, see the Panhandler [documentation](panhandler.readthedocs.io).
