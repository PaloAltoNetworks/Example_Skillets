# Skillets

A skillet is just a collection of templates with a bit of meta-data that goes along with them. Meta-data can include things like a 
name for the collection, a type that describes how the templates can be consumed, a description, optional labels, etc.

All skillets can be consumed by [Panhandler](github.com/Paloaltonetworks/panhandler), 
though other apps may exist to consume specific skillets as well. 


## Skillet types

Although most skillets consist of loadable PAN-OS configurations, Panhandler can also load additional types
of Skillets including:

* PAN-OS
* Terraform
* Python
* REST

For more information, see the Panhandler [documentation](panhandler.readthedocs.io).
