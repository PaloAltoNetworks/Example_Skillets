  This skillet demonstrates a very basic Pan-OS configuration change. This allows the user to configure the
  hostname on a Pan-OS NGFW

# type of skillet (panos or panorama or template or terraform)
type: panos

# more complex skillets may express a dependency on another skillet that should be loaded before this one.
# For example, a set of skillets may build off of a single 'golden config' that contains shared configuration
# As this skillet is very simple, there is no need to build on another one.

  collection:
    - Example Skillets
    - Configure

# variables define the things an operator may customize in this skillet. Things like DNS servers, NTP addresses, etc
# may be customized for each deployment. Each variable will be rendered as a form field in the panhandler application
variables:
  - name: FW_NAME
    description: Firewall hostname
    default: panos-01

# Snippets is an ordered list of configuration xml fragments that will be pushed to the Pan-OS NGFW. The xpath
# determines where in the configuration heirarchy the xml fragment will be set. 'file' indicates the name of the file
# to load and parse. Jinja2 style variables will be variable interpolated using the values of the 'variables' defined
# in the 'variables' section.
